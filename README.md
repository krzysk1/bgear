The Extra 330 SC is a Lycoming AEIO-580-powered single-seat aircraft with improved roll rate and easier roll stops, designed specifically for Unlimited category competition. It is actually the only single-seater aerobatic aircraft built by Extra. (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

This is free add-on for AeroflyFS developed by Krzysztof Kaniewski, 2016 ver. 1.0.
then for Aerofly FS2, February 2019
3D model created by Martins Upitis; http://devlog-martinsh.blogspot.com/]>. Thanks to him. 
Flight dynamic model based on default AeroflyFS 330LX.

Tested only on aerofly FS2 version 1.2.0.9 and Windows10. 
 Some features may not work as intended and this aircraft could crash your aeroflyFS. 
 Use it at your own risk!
 
Martins Upitis write: The BGE Air Race project is dead, but from the positive side I have some nice stuff to share with you. So I give you this nice low-poly aerobatics aircraft to play with. The model is based on Extra 300L  and I used Zivko Edge 540 cockpit as the reference for the interior.
